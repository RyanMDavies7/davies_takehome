# Roman Numeral, String Reversal, and Clock Angle Task

This project solves three tasks using Python and is designed to be production-ready, extensible, and compatible with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). The tasks include:

1. **Roman Numeral to Integer Conversion**: A function that converts Roman numerals into integers.
2. **Word Reversal in a String**: A function that reverses each word in a string while keeping the order of the words.
3. **Clock Angle Calculation**: A function that calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock, given the time.

## Features

- Extensible code structure following best practices for Python projects.
- Unit tests for each task, ensuring code reliability.
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks for automated testing locally and on the repo via Github Actions.

## Documentation
- Within the /docs directory there are multiple .md files with generic detailed documentation regarding the code and structure
