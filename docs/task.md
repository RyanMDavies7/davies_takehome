# Python Task

Create code that solves the following three tasks. The code should be production-ready, extensible, and compatible with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. If possible, please demonstrate running the code. If you need to make an assumption in order to solve the problem, please state these when presenting your code.

## Tasks:

1. **Roman Numeral to Integer**  
   Take a Roman numeral as input and return its value as an integer.  
   Examples:  
   - Input: `"MCMXC"` → Output: `1990`  
   - Input: `"MMVIII"` → Output: `2008`  
   - Input: `"MDCLXVI"` → Output: `1666`


2. **Reverse Words in a String**  
   Reverse each word in a given string while preserving the word order.  
   Example:  
   - Input: `"Hello World"` → Output: `"olleH dlroW"`


3. **Clock Angle Calculation**  
   Given the time of day (hours, minutes), return the angle between the hour and minute hands on a clock.  
   Example:  
   - Input: `(3, 30)` → Output: `75 degrees`  
   - Input: `(12, 45)` → Output: `112.5 degrees`
